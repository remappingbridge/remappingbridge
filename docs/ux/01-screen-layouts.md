# Canonical screen layouts

This file is the normative 9x21 screen and control-map contract. Unless a section says **example/dynamic body**, its text block is literal. Visible hints and hidden controls are both functional requirements.

All layouts use the retained pixel relocation in `00-interaction-visual-contract.md`.

## HOME

Hidden: Joy Up/Down Select; Key B Back (no-op because HOME is first); Key Y Lock.

```text
HOME
 STATUS
 MOUSE OPTIONS
 OTHER OPTIONS
 LEARN THE KEYS

JOY UP / DOWN: SELECT
JOY PRESS: ACCESS
KEY Y: LOCK / UNLOCK
```

## MOUSE STATUS

Body is dynamic. Hidden: Key Y Lock.

Disconnected example:

```text
MOUSE STATUS
MOUSE NOT CONNECTED
PROFILE: PASSTHROUGH
FWD: AUTO HIDPP
BACK: AUTO STD

JOY RIGHT\LEFT: PAGE
KEY B: BACK
KEY X: MOUSE HELP
```

Connected example:

```text
MOUSE STATUS
MOUSE CONNECTED
PROFILE: DEFAULT
FWD: AUTO HIDPP
BACK: AUTO STD

JOY RIGHT\LEFT: PAGE
KEY B: BACK
KEY X: MOUSE HELP
```

`MOUSE CONNECTED` is cyan. The disconnected text and the remaining ordinary status body text are off-white yellow. `PROFILE:` always reflects the confirmed active profile and may display `PASSTHROUGH`, `DEFAULT`, `ESCAPE`, or `CUSTOM`.

## OTHER DEVICES STATUS

Body is example/dynamic. Hidden: Key Y Lock.

```text

COMPOSITE

JOY RIGHT\LEFT: PAGE
KEY B: BACK
KEY X: DEVICES HELP
```

## MOUSE HELP

Body is example/dynamic.

```text

ANY KEY: BACK
```

## DEVICES HELP

```text

ANY KEY: BACK
```

## MOUSE OPTIONS

Hidden: Joy Up/Down Select; Key Y Lock.

```text
MOUSE OPTIONS
 PAIR MOUSE
 PASSTHROUGH
 DEFAULT REMAP
 ESCAPE REMAP
 CUSTOM REMAP

JOY PRESS: ACCESS
KEY B: BACK
```

When a Mouse is connected, `PAIR MOUSE` is cyan while unselected. If the selection cursor rests on it, it is white. The active profile follows the same cyan-unselected/white-selected rule.

## PAIR MOUSE

Body is example/dynamic. Hidden: Key B Back; Key Y Lock. Help is driven by the physical Key X control on the Waveshare HAT.

```text
PAIR MOUSE
SEARCHING BLE HID
TARGET MOUSE
AUTO SEARCH ACTIVE
FOUND 0 HID

KEY A: RETRY ON ERROR
KEY B: CANCEL
KEY X: HELP
```

`KEY B: CANCEL` has the same navigation rule as Back: it returns exactly one logical page, to `MOUSE OPTIONS`, without applying a pending action.

If a Mouse is already connected, accessing `PAIR MOUSE` must not show this searching screen. If the Mouse becomes connected while this searching screen is visible, the LCD must immediately leave it. Both cases open the `MOUSE PAIRED` feedback below.

## PAIR MOUSE HELP

```text
PAIR MOUSE HELP







ANY KEY: BACK
```

## MOUSE PAIRED

Positive body text is cyan. This is live connection feedback, not the later saved-device persistence feature.

```text
MOUSE PAIRED
MOUSE CONNECTED
READY TO USE




KEY B: BACK
KEY Y: LOCK
```

`KEY B: BACK` returns directly to `MOUSE OPTIONS`.

## PASSTHROUGH — before apply

```text

## EDIT CUSTOM REMAP

```text

 RIGHT IS RIGHT
 MIDDLE IS MIDDLE

 BACKWARD IS BACKWARD

JOY PRESS: ACCESS
KEY A: APPLY CUSTOM
```

When the already-active Custom profile is opened without pending changes, `KEY A: APPLY CUSTOM` is hidden until a mapping is changed.

## CUSTOM APPLIED

The five mapping rows are dynamic and show the exact confirmed Custom configuration. All five are cyan.

```text
CUSTOM APPLIED
LEFT IS RIGHT
RIGHT IS RIGHT
MIDDLE IS MIDDLE
FORWARD IS FORWARD
BACKWARD IS BACKWARD

KEY B: BACK
KEY Y: LOCK
```

The shown `LEFT IS RIGHT` is only an example of a confirmed custom mapping. `KEY B: BACK` returns directly to `MOUSE OPTIONS`.

## LEARN THE KEYS

Screen identity and HOME option remain `LEARN THE KEYS`; displayed title is `PRESS TO LEARN A KEY`. This page is literal down to character placement.

```text
PRESS TO LEARN A KEY
      JOY UP
JOY    JOY    JOY
LEFT  PRESS  RIGHT
     JOY DOWN
               KEY A
LOCK SCREEN    KEY B
 AND UNLOCK    KEY X
  OPEN HOME -> KEY Y
```

Character positions are 1-based:

- `JOY UP`: J at column 7;
- row with three `JOY`: columns 1, 8, 15;
- `LEFT`, `PRESS`, `RIGHT`: columns 1, 7, 14;
- `JOY DOWN`: J at column 6;
- `KEY A`, `KEY B`, `KEY X`: K at column 16;
- `LOCK SCREEN`: L at column 1;
- `AND UNLOCK`: A at column 2;
- `OPEN HOME -> KEY Y`: row begins at column 3.

Press feedback: each control makes only its own didactic label(s) white while held. Key Y release locks. Other controls have no normal navigation action while this screen owns interaction.
